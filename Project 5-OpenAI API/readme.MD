This project uses an OpenAI API to answer questions about different models of cars. There are three different types of questions:
1. What brand made a car with the specified name?
2. In what years was the specified car model manufactured?
3. What is the classification of the specified car brand?
This code gives a prompt to the OpenAI API and gives specific instructions on how to answer the questions. The questions are then generated randomly for random brands based on the csv file with the data, and the answers given are then compared to the csv file.

There are two files: request_test.py which is the file you should execute, and cars.csv which has the data that is comapred to the responses from OpenAI.

To execute:
1. This project requires an OpenAI API key (payment required). If you do not have one, follow the instructions at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python
2. Make sure you have the llm library installed. If not, run the following command from cmd: "pip install llm" (without quotations).
3. Execute the file request_test.py (If you set up your API key for all projects you might have to run the file from a cmd window).

Since the answers are generated by AI it is always a good idea to check to results yourself. Here are the replies I got for a typical execution of the file:
