This is a NextJS project which uses Supabase to create a login system. Users can sign up, login and logout and their credentials are kept in a Supabase datebase.
In addition, users are sent a confirmation email upon signup, using a custom gmail SMTP server.
The Create book page on the navigation bar is kept hidden from anonymous users-only signed in users may access it.
