This project was the submission to the final assignment for my Graphical Models For Deep Learning course in my Computer Science degree.
The assignment was as to use two databases-MNIST (digits) and CIFAR10 (animals and objects), and to use an algorithm that trains itself only on images from MNIST but can clasisfy
both the images from MNIST and CIFAR10 (with the images from CIFAR10 being classified as 10, meaning-out of distribution).
An explanation of our code and our motivation can be found in the notebook itself.

To execute, make sure you have numpy, matplotlib, torch, torchvision and sklearn installed-if not, execute the following command in command prompt without the quotation marks: "pip install numpy" (or the names of the other packages).
Then, run all of the cell in Project/GMDL_Final_Project.ipynb.
